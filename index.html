        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>The recent California wildfire has devastated countless families, especially single parents who are struggling to rebuild their lives. Your support can make a significant impact in helping them recover and rebuild.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About the Fundraiser</h2>
        <p><b>The Situation</b></p>
        <p>The California wildfire has left single parents particularly vulnerable. Many have lost their homes and belongings, and they face unique challenges in providing stability and care for their children during this difficult time.</p>
    
        <p><b>How the Funds Will Be Used</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Emergency Aid:</b> Supplying essential resources like food, clean drinking water, clothing, and temporary shelter to single-parent families displaced by the wildfire. This support ensures that they have access to basic necessities while they focus on recovery. Emergency aid will also include hygiene kits, baby supplies such as formula and diapers, and transportation assistance to safe locations. Volunteers will work around the clock to deliver these supplies directly to affected families.</li>
            <li><b>Rebuilding Efforts:</b> Helping single parents rebuild their homes and create a safe environment for their children. This includes providing financial assistance, construction materials, and labor to repair or reconstruct damaged properties. Special attention will be given to ensuring homes are equipped with fire-resistant materials and features that enhance safety. Additionally, community rebuilding projects will focus on restoring schools, parks, and essential infrastructure to bring a sense of normalcy back to their lives.</li>
            <li><b>Childcare Support:</b> Offering resources to ensure children can continue their education and access childcare while parents rebuild. This includes establishing temporary daycare facilities, providing educational supplies like books and digital devices, and covering tuition fees for displaced students. Partnering with local schools and organizations, we aim to create after-school programs that provide a safe and nurturing environment for children, helping them cope with the emotional impact of the wildfire.</li>
            <li><b>Emotional and Mental Health Services:</b> Providing counseling and support for both parents and children to help them cope with the trauma caused by the wildfire. Professional therapists and counselors will offer individual and group therapy sessions to address anxiety, depression, and grief. Special programs will focus on building resilience and emotional well-being in children, such as art therapy and recreational activities designed to help them process their experiences in a safe and supportive environment.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p><b>A Personal Story</b></p>
        <p>Among those impacted is a single mother of three who lost her home and business. Despite these hardships, she has been working tirelessly to provide for her children while helping others in her community. Her story reminds us of the resilience and strength of single parents who need our help to overcome these challenges.</p>
    
        <p>Together, we can make a difference in their lives. Thank you for your generosity!</p>
